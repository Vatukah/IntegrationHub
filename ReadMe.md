## 🧩 Key Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- **Auth0 integration** for user login and identity management.  
- AI Agents get controlled access to user data using **Auth0 for AI** authorization.  
- OAuth2 flow for external integrations (Gmail, Notion, Slack, HubSpot, etc.).

### 🤖 Agentic AI Layer
- AI Agents can **understand tasks**, **plan multi-step actions**, and **execute across tools**.
- Uses LLM reasoning (OpenAI or similar) to determine best actions dynamically.
- Capable of working with structured APIs (e.g., Slack API, Notion API) using secure tokens.

### 🔄 Integration System
- Each external service (Gmail, Notion, etc.) is a modular **integration adapter**.
- Agents can query or modify data through these adapters.
- Support for **custom automation rules** (like “If email received → summarize → post to Slack”).

### 🧠 Example Workflow
1. User connects Gmail and Slack.
2. AI Agent detects a new client email.
3. It summarizes the content using AI.
4. Then, it posts the summary to the team’s Slack channel automatically.
